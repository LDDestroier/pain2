# PAIN 2

#### FEATURES (so far):
- Drawing on a canvas (only one color so far)
- Scrolling
- Shifting all dots on the canvas
- A modular tool system
- little else

But what's more imporant...
###### PAIN 2 is a dumb name and I wish I picked a better one from the start
Here's a list of potential other names:
- CBrush
 - Pun on ZBrush
 - Could be confused with being a 3D tool...
- Paintu
 - Pun on "Pain 2"
 - Dumb
 - Stupid
- CIMP
 - "Computercraft Image Manipulation Program"
 - Play on GIMP
 - Sounds awkward
- Limn
 - It means to paint, but with words
 - Obscure word == instant fancy
 - Who the fuck is going to know what that word means
- Dye
 - It means to paint, with paint
 - Short and convenient to type in a terminal
 - Thematically consistent with PAIN (pain, die, the works)

#### ABOUT:
I intend for PAIN 2 (or whatever I call it) to be a simple-to-use, modular paint program that has at least as many features as PAIN 1, but without needing to memorize a bunch of arbitrarily defined hotkeys.

PAIN 1 was cool and shit, but the abundance of hotkeys and lack of a robust tool system made it difficult to learn, which is pretty terrible considering who's going to bother using ComputerCraft to make pictures.

One thing I'm definitely going to do in PAIN 2 is depending on multiple files, which PAIN sorta didn't do. PAIN was a single file, and while that portability was nice, it made it a fucking nightmare to look through. It didn't help that I was pretty inexperienced when I started coding PAIN, and still was while I had been updating it.
